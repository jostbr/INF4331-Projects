File with Cython implementation: MandelbrotPkg/mandel_cython/mandelbrot_cython.pyx

When comparing the runtime the following values for the parameters where used:
x_min = -2.5, x_max = 1.0, y_min = -1.0, y_max = 1.0,
width = 200, height = 200, max_escape_iter = 1000

Runtime comparison:
By using Cython we achive a runtime (with the same input) of 0.05s which is about
86 times as fast as the pure Python implementation and about 8 times as fast as Numpy.
So we see that this version performs extremely much faster than pure Python and
significantly faster than NumPy. With Cython we get to take more direct advantage of
C's fast loops and even the loop on each gridpoint (which we couldn't vectorize in 4.2)
are computed in C. This combined with the use of all variables as C defined types and
maybe numpy array passing from Cython to Python, provides good speed. Using list
instead of NumPy array here might not have given the same amount of speedup (even though
no NumPy vectorization is done).

See report4.txt in MandelbrotPkg/mandel_swig/report4.txt for a table comparing runtimes for all
four implementations.
